Hi! I am a final year CS PhD candidate at Cornell Univeristy. I am currently a member of the <a href='https://portal.cs.cornell.edu/'>PoRTaL lab</a>, working with <a href='https://www.sanjibanchoudhury.com/'>Prof. Sanjiban Choudhury</a>. For Summer 2025, I am a Research Intern at Adobe, working with <a href='https://research.adobe.com/person/stefano-petrangeli/'>Stefano Petrangeli</a> on AI assistants for content creation.

I work on <em>interactive AI agents that learn and act given different levels of information (e.g., goal specification, vague language feedback, few-shot video demonstrations)</em>.

My research focuses on LLM agents, imitation learning (IRL), and foundation models for robotics.

I did my undergrad at Harvey Mudd College, where I did research in a wide range of areas: human-robot interactions(<a href='https://www.cs.hmc.edu/HEAT/'>@HEATlab</a>), underwater robotics (<a href='https://www.lair.hmc.edu/'>@LAIR</a>), and experimental airplane construction (<a href='https://www.hmc.edu/engineering/undergraduate-research-experiences/david-harris-research-group/'>@HMC Aero Lab</a>).
